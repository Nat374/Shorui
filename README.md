## Keypoints
- If you want to make your new document a copy of a template, include the date in the name or change the theme of the UI; it's possible.
- Simple and fast; create a new note or category in 2 clicks; quick and easy; focus on your note, not the software.
- You can leave at any time. This software creates a simple-to-navigate folder structure, so even when you don't have Shorui, you are not tied to using it.
